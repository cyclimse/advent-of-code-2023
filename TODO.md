# TODOs

- [ ] Improve handling of different AOC parts. Right now I just comment part1 to run part2.
- [ ] Check out different parser options instead of using `std.mem.split` every time.
- [ ] Automatically download input files? Probably not worth it.
- [ ] Add a regex library. Will probably be needed for some of the problems.
